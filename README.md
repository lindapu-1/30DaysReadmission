# 30DaysReadmission

## Group Member (Group 22)

## Overview
The objective of this project is to develop statistical models for predicting hospital readmissions using Electronic Health Record (EHR) data or multimodal data. Participants have the flexibility to choose one or both modalities for their prediction. The performance of the models will be evaluated through a Kaggle competition. Participants are required to participate in the competition and submit our results on the provided Kaggle link.

**We utilized an extensive array of state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning models, training them on Electronic Health Record (EHR) data. By doing so, we aim to provide a nuanced understanding of these models' performance on smaller datasets and contribute valuable insights to the ongoing discourse.**

10 different traditional machine learning algorithms and deep learning architectures used include **XGBoost, Gradient Boost, Logistic Regression, KNN, LDA, LSTM, MLP, GNN, Metric Learning, Fusion network**. The evaluation metric is ROC-AUC and our best model acheives 0.800037.
